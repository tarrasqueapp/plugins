  <h2 align="center">Plugin Repository</h2>
</p>

This is the official plugin repository for [Tarrasque App](https://tarrasque.app). This repository contains the `plugins.json` file, which is used by the app to find and download approved plugins.

## Submitting a plugin

To have your plugin listed on the app, please submit a pull request. The pull request should add a new entry to the `plugins.json` file with a link to your plugin's manifest file.

Once your pull request is merged, your plugin will be available to be downloaded from the app automatically.

## Updating a plugin

When you make a change to your plugin, no further action is required on your part. The app will automatically load the latest version of your plugin when it is next opened.

## Removing a plugin

If you no longer want your plugin to be available in the app, you can submit a pull request to have it removed from the app. If you want to re-add your plugin in the future, you can always submit a new pull request to add it back.
